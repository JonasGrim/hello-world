# hello-world
initial practice python and getting familiar with it 
my name is Jonas, I enjoy problem solving and being able to learn new things. If im unable to learn new things or things start to get repetitive for too long in a certain area I tend to get uninterested. Im starting programming as its something that allows me to solve problems I might have as well as allow me to learn something new and interesting.
